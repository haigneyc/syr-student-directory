Executive Summary

Concept
Create the authoritative, student-focused directory of verified discounts, deals, and student perks available to Syracuse University students and nearby colleges. The site aggregates local business discounts (food, retail, entertainment, services) and relevant national student offers into a single, searchable platform.

Problem
Student discounts exist, but they are fragmented across:

Old blog posts

Word-of-mouth

Business Instagram pages

Unofficial Reddit threads

One-off campus articles

Students routinely overpay simply because they don’t know discounts exist.

Solution
A centralized, always-updated directory that:

Focuses specifically on Syracuse students

Highlights local, real-world savings

Is optimized for search and shareability

Is easy for businesses to join and promote

Why This Works

Large, renewing audience (new students every year)

High search intent (“student discount Syracuse”, “SU student deals”)

Low direct competition

Clear monetization paths (ads, affiliates, sponsored listings)

Initial Goals (First 90 Days)

Launch a clean MVP with 50–75 verified discounts

Rank on page 1 for at least 5 Syracuse-specific student discount keywords

Establish direct relationships with 10–15 local businesses

Reach break-even on hosting via ads or affiliates
